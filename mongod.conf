# --- IMPORTANT ---
# Add any other necessary configurations that your setup requires,
# otherwise MongoDB might start with incorrect defaults.
# For example, you likely need networking configured for Docker:
net:
  bindIpAll: true # Or bindIp: 0.0.0.0
  port: 27017

# If you have authentication enabled, you might need:
# security:
#   authorization: enabled

# If you are using a specific storage path via volumes, ensure it aligns or add:
# storage:
#   dbPath: /data/db
